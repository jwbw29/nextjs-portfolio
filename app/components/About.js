          I'm a former Product Owner who recently became a Full-Stack Engineer.
          I have years of experience in Product Strategy and Development,
          learning from users and how to build a user-friendly product. I wanted
          to do more of the building myself and decided to become a full-stack
          engineer. I enjoy learning new and better ways to do things and then
          applying those skills to see an idea come to reality.Â
