    "description": "This was a project that was originally created with Webpack. I wanted to convert it to NextJS as it seemed simple enough to make the migration.\nI eventually decided the project was small enough to just create a new NextJS project and rebuild this from scratch instead of doing a direct migration. Creating the UI components was as easy as expected, but I started running into issues when trying to fetch the NASA API. Previously I was using Axios and I had read that Axios was not the ideal method if you wanted to optimize your NextJS application. After trying and failing several different routes, I ultimately decided to use the Client-Side Rendering to call the API.\nI'd still like to utilize and learn more about Server-Side Rendering in NextJS so that will be my next project on this application.",

The search bar filters the results based on the current state of the input box. The scroll feature allows you to scroll through the results while keeping the header and search bar static. For styling, I used Tachyons to learn more about that package.",
